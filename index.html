            <p class="description">
              The Great Wall of China is a huge barrier that spans thousands of
              miles along China’s historic northern border. Created over
              millennia, the wall began its life as a series of smaller walls
              dating back to the 7th century BCE, built as protective barriers
              against nomadic raids.

            <p class="description">
              The Colosseum is the great oval amphitheater in the center of Rome
              where gladiators once fought for their life. The largest
              amphitheater ever built, it was constructed from sand and stone
              over eight years, from AD72 to AD80. The colossal structure could
              hold 80,000 spectators, arranged in a circular ring around the
              central stage. Dramatic and sometimes horrifying events took place
              here, not just gladiatorial games, but also Classical plays,
              animal hunts and executions.

              India’s renowned Taj Mahal (Persian for Crown of Palaces) is the
              stunning white marble mausoleum on the bank of the Yamuna River in
              the city of Agra, and it has been selected as one of the seven
              wonders of the world. Mughal emperor, Shah Jahan built the temple
              as a tomb for his beloved wife Mumtaz Mahal, who died during
              childbirth in 1631.

              The totemic statue of Christ the Redeemer stands over Rio de
              Janeiro on the top of Mount Corcovado. At 30 meters tall, this
              monument is an iconic emblem of Brazil. This huge public artwork
              was designed by the Polish-French sculptor Paul Landowski in the
              1920s and completed by Brazilian engineer Heitor da Silva Costa,
              and French engineer Albert Caquot in 1931.

            <p class="description">
              Machu Picchu is a lost treasure of the 15th century, a rare
              citadel discovered high in the Andes mountains above the Peruvian
              Sacred Valley. Astonishingly, it is one of the only pre-Columbian
              ruins found nearly intact, featuring evidence of former plazas,
              temples, agricultural terraces and homes. Archaeologists believe
              the citadel was built as an estate for the Inca emperor Pachacuti
              in around 1450 in polished drystone walls.

              Deep in the Mexican state of Yucatán lies Chichen Itza, a historic
              Mayan city built between the 9th and 12th centuries. Constructed
              by the pre-Columbian Mayan tribe Itzá, the city includes a series
              of monuments and temples. The most celebrated is El Castillo, also
              known as the Temple of Kukulcan. It is a huge step pyramid in the
              center of the city which was built as a devotional temple to the
              god Kukulkan. In total, the entire temple features 365 steps, one
              for each day of the year.

              Petra, the ancient city in southern Jordan, is also known as the
              ‘rose city’ for its golden hue. It dates as far back as 312 BC.
              Set in a remote valley, this ancient city was founded by the Arab
              Nabataeans, a sophisticated civilization that carved stunning
              architecture and complex waterways out of surrounding rock faces.
              The Nabateans also established Petra as a successful trade hub,
              earning vast wealth and a booming population before being wiped
              out by earthquakes.
